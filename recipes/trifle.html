    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A proper trifle is a thing of beauty, and when made at home it knocks anything ready-made out of the park. This strawberry trifle recipe sees layers of sherry-soaked sponge, coulis, 
        compote, custard, cream and fresh strawberries come together to create a classic example of the British dessert.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 sponge fingers (or 6 ounces sponge cake or pound cake), halved horizontally and cut into thick slices</li>

        <li>2 to 3 tablespoons sherry, optional</li>

        <li>2 cups fresh raspberries or strawberries (do not use frozen)</li>

        <li>2 cups jelly or Jell-O made to packet instructions (or make your own)</li>

        <Li>2 cups thick homemade custard (or canned)</Li>

        <Li>2 cups softly whipped cream</Li>

        <li>Whole raspberries or strawberries, garnish</li>
        
        <Li>Toasted sliced almonds, optional garnish</Li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Line the bottom of the trifle bowl or glasses with the sponge fingers or cake in a nice even layer.
            If you want to use sherry, now is the time to add it. Brush it on the sponge and let it soak in for 5 minutes.</li>
        <Li>Cover the fingers with a thick layer of raspberries or strawberries. Slowly and gently pour over 1/3 of the liquid jelly and put into the fridge—doing this will set the sponge and fruit into the bottom of the bowl. 
            Once this layer is set, pour over the remaining jelly and leave to set.</Li>
        <Li>Once set, spoon a thick layer of custard on top.</Li>
        <Li>Finish with a thick layer of whipped cream either spooned over or piped using a piping bag.</Li>
        <li>All that's left to do is to decorate as you wish, with fresh fruit, maybe almonds or chocolate—it is up to you.</li>
        <Li>Serve and enjoy.</Li>
    </ol>
